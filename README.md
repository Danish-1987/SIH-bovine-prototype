# 🐄 Indian Bovine Breed Classifier (Prototype)
---

## 📌 Problem Statement
**SIH25004** – *Image-based breed recognition for cattle and buffaloes of India*.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
We built an **AI-powered prototype** that can classify **Indian cattle & buffalo breeds** from images.  
This system can:
- Reduce manual errors in livestock breed identification.  
- Improve datasets for research and policymaking.  
- Assist during BPA registration with real-time suggestions.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload an image of cattle or buffalo.  
- Get instant prediction of breed with confidence score.  
- Interactive **Streamlit web interface**.  
- Trained on Indian bovine datasets (prototype stage).  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **Streamlit**  
- **NumPy, Pillow**
